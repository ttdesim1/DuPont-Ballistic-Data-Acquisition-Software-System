# DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition-Software-System

Date: August 2020 - Present 

The goal of this academic project is to create an application that allows DuPont users to 
create projects and records shots for their Ballistic Data Acquisition Software System. 
It features a Projects, History page, Measure page, and Advanced Settings page. 
Pycharm is being used for the development of this project, and MySQLDatabase is being used 
to create and query the database to save records of projects. The team for this project 
consists of a group of 4 that works in an agile environment to complete mockups and 
submit prototypes of the application over the course of multiple 2-week iterations.
